# ESLint in Our Project

## What is ESLint?

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a static code analysis tool that identifies problematic patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript code. It helps enforce coding standards and can automatically fix many issues.

## Our ESLint Configuration

Our ESLint configuration can be found at:

- [config/eslint.config.ts](/config/eslint.config.ts) (TypeScript-specific configuration)

## Why We Use ESLint

ESLint provides several key benefits for our project:

- **Code Consistency**: Enforces a uniform coding style across the project, making code more readable and maintainable
- **Early Error Detection**: Catches potential bugs, typos, and syntax errors before they reach production
- **TypeScript Integration**: Works seamlessly with our TypeScript codebase to ensure type safety alongside code style
- **Automated Fixes**: Many issues can be automatically fixed with `npm run lint:fix`
- **Best Practices**: Encourages established JavaScript/TypeScript best practices
- **Improved Collaboration**: Makes it easier for team members to work together with agreed-upon standards

## Using ESLint in this Project

To run ESLint in this project:

This command will check your code for linting errors and display the results in the terminal.

```bash
npm run lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors, you can use:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

ESLint is integrated into our development workflow through:

1. Pre-commit hooks to prevent committing code with linting errors
2. CI/CD pipeline validation
3. IDE integration for real-time feedback during development

By following our ESLint configuration, you help maintain a high-quality, consistent codebase that's more resilient to bugs and easier to understand for all contributors.
